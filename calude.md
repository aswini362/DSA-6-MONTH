**Remember**: Consistency beats intensity. Daily practice for 2-3 hours is better than marathon 12-hour sessions once a week. Focus on understanding concepts deeply rather than just memorizing solutions.

**Pro Tip**: Maintain a problem journal noting patterns, techniques, and common mistakes. Review it weekly to reinforce learning.
